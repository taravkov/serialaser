Faster Java Serialization with Serialaser

**Note:** this serialization framework is intended for educational purpose only. I've developed it during my diploma work at ITMO University (pusuing BSc Software Engineering). The general purpose is to show how could serialization be implemented in Java and how to make a soulution that is faster than Buil-In Java Seriliazation.
